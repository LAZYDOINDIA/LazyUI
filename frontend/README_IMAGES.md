# ðŸ¦¥ LazyDo Character Images Setup

## ðŸš€ **Quick Start**

The app is **ready to run immediately** with animated characters! The code includes:

âœ… **Automatic fallback** - Uses animated components if images don't exist  
âœ… **Smooth animations** - Yawning effect every 1.5 seconds  
âœ… **Beautiful UI** - Gradient backgrounds and modern design  

## ðŸ“¸ **To Add Your Own Character Images**

### **Option 1: Use the Generated SVG Files**

1. **Run the image generator:**
   ```bash
   cd lazydo-project/frontend
   node generate-images.js
   ```

2. **Convert SVG to PNG:**
   - Open `assets/lazydo-relaxed.svg` in a browser
   - Take a screenshot or use online converter
   - Save as `assets/lazydo-relaxed.png`
   - Repeat for `lazydo-yawning.svg`

### **Option 2: Use Your Own Images**

1. **Create your character images:**
   - `lazydo-relaxed.png` - Character relaxed/eyes open
   - `lazydo-yawning.png` - Character yawning/eyes closed
   - Size: 240x240px minimum
   - Format: PNG (transparent background recommended)

2. **Place in assets folder:**
   ```
   lazydo-project/frontend/assets/
   â”œâ”€â”€ lazydo-relaxed.png
   â”œâ”€â”€ lazydo-yawning.png
   â””â”€â”€ ... (other assets)
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works**

The app automatically:
- âœ… **Tries to load** your image files first
- âœ… **Falls back** to animated components if images missing
- âœ… **Animates smoothly** between relaxed and yawning states
- âœ… **Works on any device** without additional setup

## ðŸ“± **Test the Animation**

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Navigate to welcome screen**
3. **Watch the character animate** every 1.5 seconds
4. **Enjoy the smooth transitions!**
